# Generative AI for Anomaly Detection for Bone Diseases

## Project Overview

Welcome to the "Generative AI for Anomaly Detection for Bone Diseases" project readme. This project aims to leverage generative AI techniques to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of bone diseases using medical imaging. The project utilizes the MONAI framework and employs a diffusion model to generate counterfactual images, illustrating what a patient's bone structure would look like in the absence of any disease. The primary output of the model is a heatmap highlighting the differences between the original images and the generated counterfactual images.


## Installation

Before you can get started with this project, make sure to install the necessary dependencies. It's recommended to create a virtual environment to manage the dependencies. You can install the required packages using pip:
```
pip install monai
pip install monai-generative
```
Additionally, please ensure you have a compatible version of MONAI installed. You can find more information on installing MONAI at [MONAI Installation Guide](https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAI#installation).

## Usage

To effectively use this project, follow these high-level steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your medical image dataset containing examples of bone diseases. Make sure your dataset is well-structured and labeled.

2. **Training the Model**: Train the diffusion model using your prepared dataset. This step involves setting up and running the training process to generate counterfactual images.

3. **Generating Counterfactual Images**: After training, use the model to generate counterfactual images for specific disease images.

4. **Output and Visualization**: Examine the heatmap of differences between original and generated images to identify anomalies and potential bone diseases.

5. **Fine-tuning and Evaluation**: Optionally, fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance for specific applications and datasets.

## Data Preparation

Ensure your dataset is organized and labeled correctly. It should consist of images of bone diseases with corresponding disease labels. You may need to pre-process your data, such as resizing, normalizing, or augmenting images.
